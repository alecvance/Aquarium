  <h1 class="audio">The Music</h1>
  <p>The Aquarium sessions produced over 23 hours of music and soundscapes between Psychic Summit, Morgan Kuhli &amp; Liteworks. Our soundscapes were captured in surround at natural locations. All music was composed in sync with the visuals.</p>
  <p> The '<strong>Psychic Summit: Aquarium</strong>' album  includes our favorite tracks from these sessions. This musical collaboration will be released on digital and vinyl in 2011. If you enjoyed our music, please look for <a href="http://morgankuhli.bandcamp.com/">Morgan Kuhli's</a> soon-to-be released album 'Infinite Psychic Translations'.</p>
