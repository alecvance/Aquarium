# Aquarium
Communal Aquarium 2

This project was a joint project of Juggleware, Communal, and Psychic Summit, and was developed by Alec Vance and Joshua Warren.

Included music is copyright control, ownership reverted to the original composers.

The original version was used to control a Blu-Ray disc called "Aquarium 2", and this app was its companion piece.

It was designed as an experiment to encourage minimalist living and meditative approaches, using your portable device to help you concentrate or find peace instead of providing a distraction.
